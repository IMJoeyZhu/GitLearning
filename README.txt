Welcome to Joey's Git Learning Space.

I need to test the folloing:

Now test your passwordless authentication. I suggest this test:

1. edit your README.txt .. just add a line that says "hi bob" or whatever.
     git add README.txt # stages your changes for commit
     git commit -m "added hi bob line" # use the -m flag to create your commit message. github doesn't know about your commit yet, though..
     git push --all # this pushes your modifications to github. You should now be able to see your commit on the github website.

2. copy-paste the above commands and their results from your terminal to the text box below. Note any problems you had.
